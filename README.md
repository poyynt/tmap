# TMAP
A GRUB theme, by me (Mr. Parsa Torbati) and Mr. Alireza Mirshafiyan.
You will like this.
After extraction, with
"tar -xf tmap.tar.bz2" (without qoutes)
You will see a "configure" script.
Execute "configure" script in Terminal by:
cd /path/to/extracted/
./configure
and configuration in finished.
